Hello everyone. I'm Alex Carter, a software developer with a love for building things that make life easier. I grew up in a small town in Ohio, where my dad taught me to tinker with gadgets. That's where my love for technology began.

After college, I worked for a startup that built apps for local businesses. It was a great learning experience. I realized I wanted to use tech to solve real-world problems. So, I started my own company, TechBridge Solutions.

Now, here's what we do. We create custom software for small businesses that helps them manage everything from inventory to customer service. We've helped a local bakery triple their sales by streamlining their online orders. And a small bookstore now reaches readers all across the country thanks to our e-commerce platform.

Why do I do this? Well, I believe technology should be accessible to everyone, not just the big companies. I remember visiting my favorite bookstore as a kid, and I want those small places to thrive in this digital age. It's about giving them the tools they need to compete and grow.

And here's the thing. I love seeing their success stories. When a client tells me their business is booming, it makes my day. I'm here because I care about helping the little guys stand tall.

Thank you for letting me share my story. I hope it inspires you to think about how technology can make a difference in your world too.

Speech Analysis
This speech demonstrates how the Who-What-Why framework creates connection and credibility through structured personal storytelling.

WHO Framework Component: The speech opens without personal identification, missing an opportunity to build immediate connection. Adding a clear professional role would strengthen audience understanding of expertise and background.
WHAT Framework Component: The speech mentions professional activities but could be more specific about the exact value provided to clients or students. Consider strengthening this section by being more specific about outcomes achieved, such as "I help professionals reduce presentation anxiety by 80%" or "I guide students to achieve confident public speaking within 30 days."
WHY Framework Component: The personal motivation shines through: "technology should be accessible to everyone, not just the big companies." This emotional foundation reveals the deeper purpose driving the work, which is essential for authentic connection. This authentic sharing of values transforms a professional introduction into a meaningful conversation starter.
Framework Enhancement Suggestions:Consider shorter sentences for easier spoken delivery. The speech flows well with natural transitions between sections. The word count is well-optimized for speaking time. Good use of audience connection throughout the speech. Excellent use of concrete examples and measurable results - this strengthens credibility significantly. Consider ending with a conversation starter like "I'd love to hear about your business challenges" to encourage networking.
