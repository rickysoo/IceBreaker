Hi everyone! I'm David Westfield. I'm a community organizer and a proud advocate for local farmers. I grew up on a small farm myself, right here in our town. That's where I learned what hard work really means.

Now, I work with farmers to help them connect directly with customers. We set up markets and events so folks can get fresh produce straight from the source. It's not just about food. It's about community, and supporting each other.

You might wonder why I do this. Well, I remember one summer when drought hit us hard. We nearly lost everything. But our neighbors came together. They shared water and resources, and we made it through. That experience taught me the power of community. And that's why I care so much about helping farmers today.

So, every Saturday, you can find me at the farmer's market, chatting with locals and farmers alike. I see the joy when a kid tries a fresh apple for the first time, or when a farmer sells out of their crop. Those moments? They keep me going.

And here's the thing: We can do so much more when we come together. I've seen it firsthand. Each of us plays a part in supporting our local economy and environment. It's a small act, but it makes a big difference.

Thank you for listening. I hope next time you visit the market, you'll see the impact too. Let's keep growing together, one fresh vegetable at a time. Thanks!
