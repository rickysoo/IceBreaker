Hello everyone, I'm Jake Harmon, and I'm thrilled to be here today. I'm a digital marketing consultant, helping small businesses grow their online presence.

I started my career in a small startup, wearing many hats. That's where I learned the ins and outs of digital marketing. Over the years, I've worked with various companies, fine-tuning strategies and seeing real results.

Now, what do I do exactly? Well, I help local shops and budding entrepreneurs find their voice online. We work on creating engaging content and connecting with customers. It's about making them visible in a crowded digital world.

Let me give you an example. Last year, I worked with a small bookstore struggling to attract customers. We revamped their website, started a blog, and engaged on social media. Within months, their foot traffic increased by 30%.

So, why do I do this? I believe in the power of small businesses. They are the heart of our communities. Growing up, my parents ran a small bakery. I saw firsthand how challenging it was to reach customers without a big budget.

That's why I care about helping others succeed. It's not just about numbers for me. It's about seeing a business owner smile when they see new customers walk through their door.

And here's the thing: every business has a story worth telling. I love being a part of that story, helping them find their place online. 

Thank you for letting me share a bit about myself. I'm excited to connect with you and hear your stories too. Let's make amazing things happen together.
